2. A description of what your project does and the functionality that it provides.

TrackStream is a website where a user who wants to access songs from TV shows and movies they like can watch YouTube videos from specific episodes and films that are listed in the TuneFind API. A user would first choose either TV show or movie, then enter the title and hit the search bar. In the case of a movie, the full list of songs on the soundtrack (that are contained in the TuneFind API) would appear. The user can click on a specific song, and then the corresponding YouTube video for that song would appear on TrackStream for the user to view. In the case of a TV show, after hitting 'search' the user would be given a list of season numbers to choose from. After choosing a season number, the user is given a list of episodes by number and title, and once they choose an episode they're given the list of songs to choose from for streaming.
