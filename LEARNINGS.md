Q1. URL where application can be accessed:


Q2. A description of what your project does and the functionality that it provides.

TrackStream is a website where a user who wants to access songs from TV shows and movies they like can watch YouTube videos from specific episodes and films that are listed in the TuneFind API. A user would first choose either TV show or movie, then enter the title and hit the search bar. In the case of a movie, the full list of songs on the soundtrack (that are contained in the TuneFind API) would appear. The user can click on a specific song, and then the corresponding YouTube video for that song would appear on TrackStream for the user to view. In the case of a TV show, after hitting 'search' the user would be given a list of season numbers to choose from. After choosing a season number, the user is given a list of episodes by number and title, and once they choose an episode they're given the list of songs to choose from for streaming.


Q3. A list of at least ten different web technologies that you used in your web application and where they are used.
Suggestions based on past assignments: JSON, NodeJS/Express, JavaScript, GET requests, POST requests, Heroku.

i. Our web application's CSS styling includes the colors of the buttons and text, the hover effects for our buttons, and the buttons' colors changing to indicate that they are pressed. We have also styled the cards that contain the search results, making all of the buttons the same size and expandable when the cursor hovers over them.

ii. Trackstream utilizes the TuneFind API to identify the relevant movie or TV show titles associated with our users' searches, as well as the seasons, episodes (by name and number), and songs that are played within the movie or TV episode. We then use the YouTube API to play the video associated with the song the user wants to hear. Additionally, we have created our own API to track what our users are using TrackStream to search for and view.
